# Proof of Concept - NDF Contracts (Non-Deliverable Forward)

This repository contains the proof of concept for implementing NDF (Non-Deliverable Forward) contracts. NDF contracts are derivative agreements where two parties agree to exchange the difference between the agreed exchange rate in the contract and the market exchange rate on the settlement date, without the physical delivery of the currency.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the calculation and simulation of the settlement of an NDF contract using fictitious exchange rates. The solution aims to provide a basic environment for calculating the notional amount and the financial result of the contract based on the agreed and market rates.
